**CODEBRIM: COncrete DEfect BRidge IMage Dataset** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the construction industry. 

The dataset consists of 1590 images with 8323 labeled objects belonging to 6 different classes including *crack*, *corrosion stain*, *spallation*, and other: *exposed bars*, *efflorescence*, and *background*.

Images in the CODEBRIM dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 567 (36% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Additionally, bounding boxes with 2 or more classes are marked as ***overlapping***. Run dataset in supervisely to learn more. The dataset was released in 2019 by the Goethe University, Germany and Egnatia Odos A. E., Greece.
