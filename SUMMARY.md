**CODEBRIM: COncrete DEfect BRidge IMage Dataset** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the construction industry. 

The dataset consists of 1590 images with 8323 labeled objects belonging to 6 different classes including *crack*, *corrosion stain*, *spallation*, and other: *exposed bars*, *efflorescence*, and *background*.

Images in the CODEBRIM dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 567 (36% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Additionally, bounding boxes with 2 or more classes are marked as ***duplicate bbox***. Run dataset in supervisely to explore. The dataset was released in 2019 by the Goethe University, Germany and Egnatia Odos A. E., Greece.

Here are the visualized examples for the classes:
